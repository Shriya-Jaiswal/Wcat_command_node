Success is a journey not a destination




Never say never




Success is where preparation and opportunity meet.





Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom.





Success is the progressive realization of predetermined, worthwhile, personal goals.






When it comes to success, there are no shortcuts.




Success is not in what you have, but who you are.






Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.





If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.
